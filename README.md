 🎯 About the Project

The Problem

Counterfeit drugs kill over 1 million people annually worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that 10% of medicines in developing countries are substandard or falsified. This crisis:

- Threatens public health and patient safety
- Undermines trust in healthcare systems  
- Costs the global economy over $200 billion per year
- Disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income countries

Solution

This project addresses UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by providing an accessible, AI-powered tool that verifies drug authenticity through multiple independent verification layers.

SDG Alignment

- Primary: SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being
- Secondary: SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
- Tertiary: SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals
